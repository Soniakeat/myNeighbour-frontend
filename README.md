# Project Name
myNEIGHBOUR

## Description
myNEIGHBOUR is an app to free ourselves from all the things we accumulate and never use.
With myNEIGHBOUR, the user can propose his unused items that his neighbours need and vis & Versa. A freeway to favour recycling, reduce excessive consumption and free up space at home, revitalizing the proximity social bond.

## User Stories
- **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault

- **Login:** As a user I can log in to the platform so that I can see the items of my neighbours, my profile.
- **Logout:** As a user I can log out from the platform so no one else can use it
- **Items** As a user I can see all the items of my neighbour.
- **Item** As a user I can select one item, see all details about it and I can contact the owner to have it.
- **Add items** As a user I can add an item so that I can propose it to the community.
- **delete items** As a user I can delete an item if a neighbour has recovered it.
- **See and edit my profile** As a user I can see my profile, edit or delete it.
